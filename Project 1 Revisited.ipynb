    "For this assignment, you will revisit your first project to predict supermarket sales. You will apply what you've learned this week to explain how your models made their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project 1 Revisited - Part 1: Remaking, Saving, and Explaining Your Models\n",
    "For this part of the project, you will be producing a new version of your final project notebook using the updated tools in sklearn v1.1. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new notebook called \"Project 1 - Revisited.ipynb\" in your project repo.\n",
    "  * You may either make a copy of your prior notebook that you will modify, or you can start a new blank notebook and copy over the code from your old notebook (as needed).\n",
    "* Remake your X_train and X_test as DataFrames with the feature names extracted from the column transformer instead of combining your preprocessor and model into 1 pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LinearRegression\n",
    "* Fit and evaluate your LinearRegresion model using your dataframe X_train and X_test data.\n",
    "* Extract and visualize the coefficients that your model determined.\n",
    "   * Select the top 3 most impactful features and interpret their coefficients in plain English.\n",
    "* Save your figure as a .png file inside your repository (you will need this for the final piece of this assignment - Update Your README).\n",

    "### Tree-Based Model\n",
    "* Fit and evaluate your tree-based regression model using your dataframe X_train and X_test data.\n",

    "Insert your exported figures from above into your README file. You should have the following:\n",

    "   *  Your interpretation of your coefficients.\n",
    "*  Your tree-based model's feature importances.\n",
